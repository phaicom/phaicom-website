## Project Overview

While working at **FireOneOne**, I developed a back-office web application for a retail company to streamline internal operations.

The system focuses primarily on **inventory management** and **sales workflows**, enabling staff to efficiently manage stock levels, process orders, monitor performance, and support daily business operations.

My role as a **Frontend Developer (Vue.js)** was to deliver a responsive, user-friendly, and reliable interface used daily by operational teams.

## Core Business Workflows

### 1. Inventory Management

The inventory module allows staff to:

- Monitor real-time stock levels
- Track product availability by category
- Update product information
- Manage stock movement (inbound / outbound)
- Prevent overselling with validation workflows

The interface was designed for speed and clarity, reducing manual errors and improving stock visibility across departments.

### 2. Sales & Order Management

The sales workflow supports:

- Order tracking and status updates
- Filtering by date, status, and service type
- Sales reporting and performance metrics
- Exporting data for accounting and analysis

Special attention was given to usability, ensuring that staff could quickly locate and update orders during peak business hours.

### 3. Service & Configuration Management

The system also includes configurable service settings such as:

- Enable/disable services
- Manage service categories
- Configure pricing visibility
- Control operational toggles

This allows business users to adjust operational behavior without developer intervention.

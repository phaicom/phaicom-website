## Project Overview

**The 1** is Thailand’s leading loyalty and customer engagement platform under Central Retail, serving millions of members nationwide.

I worked as a **Contract Fullstack Developer at Apar Technologies (Bangkok)** from **October 2020 – June 2021**, assigned to The 1 Central team to develop and enhance large-scale, data-driven loyalty platforms.

My work focused on customer acquisition funnels, engagement platforms, and backend API systems that power loyalty operations across Central Retail brands.

## Core Platform Capabilities

### 1. Member Acquisition & Campaign Landing

The platform supports large-scale promotional campaigns:

- Welcome coupon campaigns
- Dynamic landing pages
- App download funnels
- First-time reward incentives
- Campaign-driven dynamic content

I implemented reusable, configurable campaign modules to allow marketing teams to launch new promotions quickly without deep system refactoring.

### 2. Loyalty & Points System

The loyalty infrastructure enables:

- Point accumulation tracking
- QR-based member identification
- Coupon redemption flows
- Tier qualification tracking
- Secure business rule enforcement at API level

I designed and implemented REST APIs using Node.js and Express to ensure system reliability and data integrity.

### 3. Exclusive Tier Experience

The system includes tier-based segmentation logic:

- Spending threshold tracking
- Exclusive member qualification
- Dynamic privilege rendering
- Personalized UI content based on membership status

This required close coordination between frontend SSR rendering (Nuxt) and backend validation logic.

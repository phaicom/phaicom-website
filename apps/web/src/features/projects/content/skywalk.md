## Project Overview

**Sky Walk** is an interactive planetarium application designed to help users identify stars and Zodiac constellations in real time.

The application allows users to simply point their device toward the sky to detect constellations and instantly learn the mythology and stories behind each Zodiac sign.

I was responsible for developing the **core game system**, including constellation interaction logic, object behavior, and immersive visual presentation within Unity.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Constellation Detection

The application enables users to:

- Identify stars and Zodiac constellations
- Visually connect star points with dynamic line rendering
- Highlight selected constellations
- Trigger constellation information through interaction

The system was built to provide a smooth and educational real-time experience.

### 2. Interactive Zodiac Experience

When a constellation is selected:

- The Zodiac figure is highlighted in 3D
- Mythology and background stories are presented
- Visual overlays enhance immersion
- Users can explore different constellations seamlessly

The goal was to merge education with engaging visual storytelling.

### 3. AR & VR Integration

The project integrates AR and VR technologies to create an immersive sky exploration experience:

- **Vuforia** for augmented reality tracking
- **Google VR SDK** for immersive viewing mode
- Optimized rendering for mobile devices
- Camera-based sky alignment and orientation logic

This allowed users to experience the night sky in a more interactive and futuristic way.

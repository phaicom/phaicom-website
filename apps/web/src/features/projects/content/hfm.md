## Project Overview

**HFM (HF Markets)** is a global multi-asset trading platform serving clients across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Since **August 2025**, I have been developing localized promotional and marketing platforms for multiple Asian markets, ensuring high performance, strong SEO visibility, and consistent global brand alignment.

My work focuses on:

- Localized promotional campaign pages
- Regional marketing initiatives
- SEO-optimized landing pages
- High-performance SSR/ISR architecture
- Cross-region content alignment

## Localized Promotion & Marketing Development

I develop region-specific promotional pages tailored for Asian markets, including:

- Deposit bonus campaigns
- Trading competitions
- Seasonal regional promotions
- Country-targeted marketing funnels

Each localized page requires:

- Language-specific content structure
- SEO optimization (metadata, structured content, indexing strategy)
- Performance tuning across regions
- Cultural and regulatory alignment

The system ensures regional customization without breaking global brand consistency.

## SEO & Performance Optimization

Given that marketing traffic is highly SEO and paid-ad driven, performance is critical.

Key optimization areas:

- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Static generation (where applicable)
- Optimized meta tags and structured data
- Image optimization & lazy loading
- Lighthouse performance improvements
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

This ensures strong search visibility and reduced bounce rates across multiple Asian markets.

## Project Overview

**Hjem.no** is a real estate marketplace platform designed to help users search, filter, and explore properties through an intuitive web interface and interactive map experience.

I worked as a **Frontend Developer at Zrch (Bangkok)** from **June 2021 – March 2022**, developing both the public-facing property website and an internal advertising/admin dashboard system.

The platform focuses on:

- Property listing discovery
- Advanced filtering
- Interactive map-based search
- Detailed property pages
- Advertising management tools for agents/admins

## Core User Features

### 1. Advanced Property Search & Filtering

Users can:

- Search by location and keyword
- Filter by property type
- View listings for sale or rent
- Apply pricing and category filters
- Toggle between grid and list view

The filtering logic was designed to be fast, dynamic, and API-driven to ensure a smooth browsing experience.

### 2. Interactive Map-Based Discovery

The platform integrates map functionality allowing users to:

- View clustered property markers
- Draw search areas
- Zoom and dynamically load results
- Switch between map and list view
- See real-time property counts

This required tight synchronization between map state and listing results.

### 3. Property Detail Experience

Each property page includes:

- Large image galleries
- Pricing breakdown
- Agent contact modules
- Property facts and specifications
- Clear call-to-action elements

The layout was optimized for readability and user conversion.

## Admin & Advertising Dashboard

In addition to the public website, I built an internal admin dashboard that allows:

- Property advertisement creation and editing
- Listing status management
- Content moderation
- Configuration of promotional content
- Data-driven updates from backend APIs

The admin interface was built using **Vue 3 + Material Design**, focusing on usability and maintainability.
